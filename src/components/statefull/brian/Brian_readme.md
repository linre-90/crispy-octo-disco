# website support bot Brian component.

Note: 
    Brian was developed in seperate process and just thrown in here. This is why it is in js and tsx. 
    It can operate propably on any site but requires gatsby, react, fortawesome and graphql data in this state although gatsby and graphql can be pretty easily changed...


## Brian is not meant to be very intelligent nearly a assisted search feature and it is only made for this site.
## Brian may or may not get some other features in the future...
